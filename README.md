# TitanicCaseStudy
Project Name : Titanic Survival Predictor
Technology : Supervised Machine Learning with Logistic Regression using python.
Description : This Application is based on supervised machine learning techniques. Thre is one data set which contains the Information of all Pasengers from titanic such as its name , age , seat number , ticket price , height , floor , etc. We first clean the data set by removing the unnecessary entries and columns.
